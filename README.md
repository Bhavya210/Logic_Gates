# VHDL Logic Gates Implementation

## Overview
This VHDL code repository provides concise implementations of basic logic gates, including AND, OR, NOT and XOR gates. Additionally, a comprehensive test bench code is included for each logic gate to facilitate functional verification.

## Contents
1. **AND Gate (and_gate.vhdl):** VHDL code for an AND gate.
2. **OR Gate (or_gate.vhdl):** VHDL code for an OR gate.
3. **NOT Gate (not_gate.vhdl):** VHDL code for a NOT gate.
4. **XOR Gate (or_gate.vhdl);** VHDL Code for a XOR gate.
5. **Test Bench (and_tbh.vhdl, or_tbh.vhdl, not_tbh.vhdl, xor_tbh):** Test bench code for each logic gate to verify their functionality using Xilinx Vivado.

## How to Use
1. Open the respective VHDL files for the logic gates in a VHDL-compatible development environment such as Xilinx Vivado.
2. Simulate the design to observe the gate's behavior and waveform.
3. For a more comprehensive verification, use the provided test bench files by opening them in the same development environment and running simulations.

## Important Notes
- Ensure that you have Xilinx Vivado installed to analyze and simulate the VHDL code effectively.
- Customize the code or integrate it into your larger digital design projects as needed.
- Refer to the test bench files for examples of how to verify the correctness of the implemented logic gates.
